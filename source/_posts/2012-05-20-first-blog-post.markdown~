Hey,I'm Samitha Liyanage.I was an Electrical Engineer and now I'm looking to shift my career to Software Engineering.I have a cute baby girl and loving husband. My husband is a computer science phd student and he is the major backup support on my career change.

I have already started programming and will share my programming experiences and good parenting tips through this blog.

This is my beautifull family. We took this at Eirie Lake beach on the way back from Niagara Falls.
